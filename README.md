<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This repository is a hands-on SQL practice project built around an employees sample dataset. It collects multiple .sql scripts that demonstrate core and intermediate SQL techniques â€” joins (including advanced joins), subqueries, set operations, and conditional logic using CASE â€” and culminates in a final project file consolidating those queries. The project is ideal for anyone learning how to explore an employee dataset, write multi-table queries, and practice real-world SQL tasks.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="project-learning"></a>project-learning</h2>

- Designing and running multi-table `SELECT` queries using `JOIN` types.

- Building conditional logic with `CASE`.

- Writing subqueries and combining results with set operations.

- Structuring a small SQL project from data load â†’ exploratory queries â†’ consolidated deliverable.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>Dataset</h2>

The project uses a sample Employees dataset designed to simulate a real-world company database for SQL learning and analysis.
The dataset is stored in the file employees Data.sql, which contains SQL scripts for creating tables and inserting sample records.

**Key Tables:**

- **Employees** â€“ Employee ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, Job ID, Salary, Manager ID, Department ID
- **Departments** â€“ Department ID, Department Name, Location ID
- **Jobs** â€“ Job ID, Job Title, Minimum Salary, Maximum Salary
- **Locations** â€“ Location ID, City, State, Country

<h2><a class="anchor" id="tools--technologies"></a>Tools & Technologies</h2>

- **SQL Database Platforms:** MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (depending on your setup)
- **SQL Clients / IDEs:** MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, pgAdmin, Azure Data Studio
- **Languages:** SQL (DDL, DML, DQL)
- **Data Handling & Analysis:** Joins, Subqueries, CASE statements, Set Operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)

<h2><a class="anchor" id="data-cleaning--preparation"></a>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h2>

- Checked for missing or NULL values in critical columns (Employee_ID, Department_ID, Job_ID, Salary).

- Verified that numeric columns (Salary, Employee_ID, Department_ID) were integers.

- String columns (First_Name, Last_Name, Email) were standardized for length and format.

- Confirmed no duplicate primary keys existed in main tables (Employees, Departments, Jobs)

<h2><a class="anchor" id="key-findings"></a>Key Findings</h2>

- `employees Data.sql` â€” script that appears to create and/or populate the employees sample tables.

- `Join's Queries.sql` â€” a set of exercises/examples focused on JOIN operations.

- `Advance Join's Part.sq` â€” more advanced join scenarios and patterns.

- `Subqueries, Set operation, Case.sql` â€” examples of subqueries, set operations (UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT) and CASE expressions.

- `SQL final project.sql` â€” a final project file that ties together queries and tasks from the other scripts.
(These file names and their presence are taken from the repo file list.) `GitHub`

<h2><a class="anchor" id="how-to-run-this-project"></a>How to Run This Project</h2>

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashkdm987/SQL-Employees-Data-Analysis-Project.git
```
2. Open your SQL client (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver, Azure Data Studio, SQLite CLI, etc.).

3. Run `employees Data.sql` first to create tables and load sample data.

4. Run the other `.sql` files in a logical order (JOINs â†’ advanced joins â†’ subqueries & set ops â†’ final project) to see queries execute and inspect results.
