<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This repository is a hands-on SQL practice project built around an employees sample dataset. It collects multiple .sql scripts that demonstrate core and intermediate SQL techniques â€” joins (including advanced joins), subqueries, set operations, and conditional logic using CASE â€” and culminates in a final project file consolidating those queries. The project is ideal for anyone learning how to explore an employee dataset, write multi-table queries, and practice real-world SQL tasks.

- Designing and running multi-table `SELECT` queries using `JOIN` types.

- Building conditional logic with `CASE`.

- Writing subqueries and combining results with set operations.

- Structuring a small SQL project from data load â†’ exploratory queries â†’ consolidated deliverable.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>Dataset</h2>

The project uses a sample Employees dataset designed to simulate a real-world company database for SQL learning and analysis.
The dataset is stored in the file employees Data.sql, which contains SQL scripts for creating tables and inserting sample records.

**Key Tables:**

- **Employees** â€“ Employee ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, Job ID, Salary, Manager ID, Department ID
- **Departments** â€“ Department ID, Department Name, Location ID
- **Jobs** â€“ Job ID, Job Title, Minimum Salary, Maximum Salary
- **Locations** â€“ Location ID, City, State, Country

<h2><a class="anchor" id="data-cleaning--preparation"></a>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h2>

- Checked for missing or NULL values in critical columns (Employee_ID, Department_ID, Job_ID, Salary).

- Verified that numeric columns (Salary, Employee_ID, Department_ID) were integers.

- String columns (First_Name, Last_Name, Email) were standardized for length and format.

- Confirmed no duplicate primary keys existed in main tables (Employees, Departments, Jobs)
