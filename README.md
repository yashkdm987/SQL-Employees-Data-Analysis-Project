<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This repository is a hands-on SQL practice project built around an employees sample dataset. It collects multiple .sql scripts that demonstrate core and intermediate SQL techniques â€” joins (including advanced joins), subqueries, set operations, and conditional logic using CASE â€” and culminates in a final project file consolidating those queries. The project is ideal for anyone learning how to explore an employee dataset, write multi-table queries, and practice real-world SQL tasks.

- Designing and running multi-table -`SELECT` queries using -`JOIN` types.

- Building conditional logic with -`CASE`.

- Writing subqueries and combining results with set operations.

- Structuring a small SQL project from data load â†’ exploratory queries â†’ consolidated deliverable.
